## Introduction

The syntax and semantics of context-free grammars (CFGs) can be complex, and creating or modifying grammars can be challenging. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive set of strategies and tools to help you debug custom grammars effectively.
`transformers_cfg` used EBNF notation to define grammars.
In particular, it is aligned with the grammar module of [llama-cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master/grammars).
This [doc from llama-cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master/grammars) provides a good introduction to EBNF grammars(it is called `gbnf` in llama-cpp, but for simplicity, you can consider it as `ebnf` without bothering)


## Syntax Highlighting

There is a vscode extension called `EBNF` which provides syntax highlighting for EBNF grammars.
Here is how it looks like:

## Variants of EBNF

EBNF is a notation rather than a strict standard.
There exist several different variants of EBNF, each having a slightly different syntax but the same underlying semantics.

The two major variants are:
- [ISO/IEC 14977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) - The original standard for EBNF
- [W3C EBNF](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-notation) - The variant used in the W3C XML specification

The EBNF variant used in `transformers_cfg` is mostly aligned with the W3C EBNF variant, but has one small difference:
- The negation operator is `^` is not yet supported in `transformers_cfg`, we will add it in the future.

## Check parsing of EBNF grammar

Suppose you have written an EBNF grammar and want to know if it is correct or not.
The first step is to check if it can be parsed by the `transformers_cfg/parser::parse_ebnf` function.
`python -m transformers_cfg.parser ----grammar-file examples/grammars/your_grammar.ebnf`

Example output for json grammar is:
```terminal

```

If the grammar can be parsed, it means that it is syntactically correct.

## Test the grammar with a simple input

After you have checked that the grammar can be parsed, you can test it with a simple input to see if it can generate the expected output.
We provide a simple script to do this:
```python
from transformers_cfg.parser import parse_ebnf
from transformers_cfg.recognizer import GrammarRecognizer

with open("examples/grammars/json.ebnf", "r") as file:
    input_text = file.read()
parsed_grammar = parse_ebnf(input_text)

start_rule_id = parsed_grammar.symbol_table["root"]
recognizer = GrammarRecognizer(parsed_grammar.grammar_encoding, start_rule_id)

# Test the grammar with a simple input
json_input = '{"foo": "bar", "baz": "bat"}'
is_accepted = recognizer._accept_string(json_input, recognizer.stacks)
print(is_accepted)
```

If the above script returns `True`, it means that the grammar can recognize the input string.
If it returns `False`, it means that the grammar cannot recognize the input string.
In this case, you need to check in which step the input string is rejected.
N.B. the recognizer can accept partial input, so you can try the following:
```python
json_input = '{"foo": "bar"'
is_accepted = recognizer._accept_string(json_input, recognizer.stacks)
print(is_accepted)
```

This helps you to see where the grammar fails to recognize the input string.

## DEBUG mode

You can enable the DEBUG mode to see the parsing process of the input string.
```bash
export TCFG_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

The output will be like:
```terminal

```

This helps you to see the parsing process of the input string.

## Incremental Development and Testing

Best practices for building the grammar is start with a minimal rule and then add more rules.

## Isolating Grammar Components

When a grammar is not working as expected, it can be helpful to isolate specific components of the grammar to identify the source of the issue.
Remove or comment out parts of the grammar to see if the issue persists, and gradually reintroduce components to identify the source of the issue.

## Test with language model

Up to this point, the grammar should already be correct and the rest of the issues are not related to the grammar itself.
Testing with language model is important but it is not grammar related anymore.
