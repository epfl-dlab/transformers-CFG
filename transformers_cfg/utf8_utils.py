class PartialUTF8:
    """
    A data class representing the state of a partially decoded UTF-8 sequence.

    Attributes:
    - value (int): The current accumulated value of the partially decoded Unicode code point.
                   This attribute stores the bits that have been decoded so far. For a fully decoded
                   character or before any partial decoding has started, this would typically be `0`.

    - n_remain (int): The number of bytes remaining to complete the current UTF-8 encoded character.
                      A value of `-1` indicates that there is no ongoing partial decoding, i.e.,
                      either decoding has not started, or the last character was fully decoded.

    This class is used to handle situations where UTF-8 encoded data may end in the middle of a character
    sequence, allowing for the decoding process to be resumed when more data becomes available.
