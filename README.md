# ðŸ¤— Transformers CFG

## Latest News

**Integration with Text-Generation-WebUI** (2023-12-17)

We are thrilled to announce that `transformers_cfg` has been used in the [Text-Generation-WebUI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) project.
This integration enables users to utilize our CFG capabilities within the popular, 30.5K-starred web interface for text generation.
For more details, see [Relevent Pull Request](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/pull/4953)




## Introduction
`transformers_cfg` is an extension library for the popular Transformers library by Hugging Face, tailored for working with context-free grammars (CFG).
This package provides additional tools and functionalities to enhance your experience with natural language processing tasks involving CFGs.

It was initially developed as a pull request to the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library.
See relevant discussion [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/27557).

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Saibo-creator/transformers-CFG.git
```

## QuickStart: Force LLM to generate a valid json object

The below example can be found in `examples/run_grammar_constrained_generation.py`

```python

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from transformers_cfg.recognizer import IncrementalGrammarConstraint
from transformers_cfg.generation.logits_process import GrammarConstrainedLogitsProcessor

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load model and tokenizer
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")

    # Load json grammar
    with open("examples/grammars/json.ebnf", "r") as file:
        grammar_str = file.read()
    grammar = IncrementalGrammarConstraint(grammar_str, "root", tokenizer)
    grammar_processor = GrammarConstrainedLogitsProcessor(grammar)

    # Generate
    prefix1 = "This is a valid json string for http request:"
    prefix2 = "This is a valid json string for shopping cart:"
    input_ids = tokenizer([prefix1, prefix2], add_special_tokens=False, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)["input_ids"]

    output = model.generate(
        input_ids,
        do_sample=False,
        max_length=50,
        num_beams=2,
        logits_processor=[grammar_processor],
        repetition_penalty=5.0,
        num_return_sequences=1,
    )
    # decode output
    generations = tokenizer.batch_decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True)
    print(generations)

    """
    'This is a valid json string for http request:{ "request": { "method": "GET", "headers": [], "content": "Content","type": "application" }}
    'This is a valid json string for shopping cart:This is a valid json string for shopping cart:{ "name": "MyCart", "price": 0, "value": 1 }
    """

```

## Grammar Collection

We provide a collection of grammars in the `examples/grammars` folder, which are mostly identical to the grammars in llama-cpp project.
We try to keep the grammars up-to-date with the original grammars from llama-cpp project.
But up to now, we can not yet guarantee that all grammars from llama-cpp project can be directly used in transformers-CFG.

The list of grammars contains:
- `json.ebnf`: A grammar for generating valid json objects.
- `c.ebnf`: A grammar for generating valid C programs.
- `chess.ebnf`: A grammar for generating valid chess moves.
- `arithmetic.ebnf`: A grammar for generating valid arithmetic expressions.


## Why should I use transformers-CFG?

- We offer the same grammar interface as llama-cpp project, allowing you to drop-in replace llama-cpp with transformers-CFG.
- We allow you to use any of the models in the ðŸ¤— Transformers library, including the ones that are not supported by llama-cpp.

## Supported Models

`Transformers-CFG` is tokenizer-dependent and model-agnostic.
All models with the same tokenizer should naturally be supported.

We have tested the following models:
- `gpt2`
- `LLaMa` (and its variants and `LLaMa-2`)
- `t5` (in progress)

If you find any model that is not supported, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
